# sign-up-form

Hello everyone! This is going to be my first project for Odin Project that is not in the Foundations course. Today, I will be making a simple sign up form design, which will help me demonstrate my proficiency in intermediate topics of HTML and CSS such as positioning, forms, client-side validation and styling with pseudo classes/pseudo elements. With that being said, credits for all the materials used in this project will be listed here below this paragraph of text. Please go show the creators some love, and thank you for viewing this repo!
